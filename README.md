# Machine Learning project 2 - Predictive Modeling for Term deposit (Banking sector) 

<div align="justify">This project consists of machine learning models that predict if clients will subscribe to term deposits or not before marketing campaigns to assist banks in improving revenue while performing cost-efficient marketing efforts, therefore increasing profits. Marketing campaigns for subscribing to term deposits have various independent factors to consider, such as client age, job, marital status, education level, day and month of contact, etc. In this project, five algorithms – namely Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-NN, Naïve Bayes, Classification Tree, and Logistic Regression – have been tested to model relationships between independent factors for subscribing to term deposits. Test results show the best performance by the Classification Tree, which has an overall accuracy of 87%, and an AUC of 92% in predicting whether or not clients will subscribe to term deposits.</div>
